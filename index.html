<h2>  Welcome to my website  </h2>
<h1> About Me </h1>


 "Aspiring junior software developer and tester with a background of Business Management and accounting" 
<br> <br>
I have been living in Toronto since I was 5, and have a diversity of friends. I believe in equal rights, and respect for others. I am someone who would like to step up and defend those whom are too vulnerable to do so themselves. I also like to encourage people to voice their thoughts, because no idea is a bad idea. 
<br> <br>
During my free time I like to go for hikes and sight see. The image at the top of my website was taken in Dominican Republic when I woke up at 5am to see the sunrise. I enjoy walking new paths because every path has its own adventure stored. When I am unavailable to venture to new destinations, I like to read blogs to plan for future opportunities to explore. I like to set S.M.A.R.T goals, from career planning to places I want to explore.
<br> <br>
I became passionate about the IT industry after working as a QA analyst on a project for Pinterest at Cognizant, a multibillion dollar IT consulting firm. I got exposure to working in an agile environment and became extremely interested in learning more technical skills. This is why I chose to take part of the Npower Software and Development Program because Npower helps student hone their technical skills while developing a professional mindset.

Here at NPower I have learned C#, Java and how to write this website from scratch. Please see my portfolio for some of the work I've done within 5 weeks of this program. In addition to these new languages learnt, I have previous experience in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel. Some tools I use on a regular basis are Trello to conduct my Scrum meetings, Slack to communicate with my co-workers, Google Drive and Github to manage my projects and work, Visual Studio and Netbean to write my applications. I am currently using Sublime Text to write my website, but I am also familiar with using NotePad. Please view my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByGygL5k1IMVVjhKaUd4Q2ZhcU0">resume</a> for a more detailed list of my qualifications.

 <h1> Experience and Education </h1>
 <p>
I have extensive experience working in the customer service industry as I have been working since I was 16. I have been complimented on a regular basis for being attentive and passionate. I would like to take my experience towards my passion and develop a career in IT. 
<br> <br>
I have completed a certificate In Business Management at Ryerson University. It is equivalent to a year of the Business Management Degree Program. I have also completed a year of Business Administration in Accounting at George Brown College, where I came to realize I want some time off school to find my passion. 
<br> <br>
Having been exposed to the IT field as a QA analyst at Cognizant, my passion for IT grew. I like how there is so much to learn in the IT industry and how there is so much room for career development. However because I did not have much technical background, I chose to quit my job to build a solid foundation with Npower, a well operated non-profit IT training organization. During my time in the Npower Software Development and Testing Program I have interacted with different languages such as C#, and Java and I am currently working on this webpage with HTML and CSS. I hope to obtain my MTA and ISQTB certification by the end of the program, and I cannot wait to start venturing my career in IT industry.
